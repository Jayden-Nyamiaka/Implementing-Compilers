Grading notes for assignment 2
==============================

Author: Adishree Ghatare

OVERALL GRADE: 95/100
GRADE AFTER REWORK: 100/100

Good job! Generally quite readable code.
All behavioral tests pass.
Failing single-pass tests: remove complex.

== Style

You are frequently using `if` / `then` clauses when `match` might be
more appropriate. For example, in `uncover_live.ml:add_read_regs`,
you can use `(idx, aft)` matching to pull out `0, _` and `_, h :: t` cases.
(You could also use `take` or `LocSet.map` to simplify that function,
in particular.)

== Comments

* remove complex

You are failing this single-pass test: probably for similar reasons
to last week.

* select instructions

* uncover live

* build interference

Using a `List.fold_left` would simplify a lot of this code: 
`add_edge_comp_two`, `instr_helper`, `run_helper`. I don't think it's
necessary to rewrite all of this: maybe you can just do `add_edge_comp_two` 
for practice and keep this in mind in the future assignments.

* graph coloring

* allocate registers

* patch instructions

`convert_block`: Update your error message (should mention
`allocate_registers` rather than `assign_homes`).

* prelude and conclusion
