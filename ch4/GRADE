== Comments

* shrink

* uniquify

line 24: You should make the order of operations for these recursive
calls explicit. 

* remove complex operands

* explicate control

You should make order of operations explicit in `explicate_assign`.

* remove unused

* select instructions

`cc_of_op` (provided in Types) simplifies code around lines 43 and 63.
I would recommend giving all the provided functions a glance!

* uncover live

Nice, formatting made this particularly easy to read. :)

* build interference

* allocate registers

* remove jumps

* patch instructions

* prelude and conclusion
